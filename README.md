## üí° My Approach

When I started this project, I first analyzed several Shopify stores to understand their structure. I noticed that while they all use the Shopify platform, each store has its own unique theme and layout. This meant I couldn't rely on a single approach to extract data.

I decided to implement a multi-strategy approach for each data point:

1. **Primary Strategy**: Try the most common pattern first
2. **Fallback Strategies**: If the primary strategy fails, try alternative approaches
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Return partial data rather than failing completely

For example, with FAQs, I first look for definition lists (dt/dd pairs), then header/paragraph pairs, and finally accordion components. This ensures we get data even from stores with unusual layouts.

The most interesting discovery was that all Shopify stores expose their product catalog via the `/products.json` endpoint, which made that part much easier than initially expected.
